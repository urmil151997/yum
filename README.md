YUM CONFIGURATION THROUGH ANSIBLE

Just attach cd on server  side and give the path in src[]

Note - It will take sometime because whole iso file is being uploaded from server to client. Once uploaded the process it fast 
as ansible is all about automation so we should not attach it manually from client  

ansible support .yml extension and it can be  also called as Playbook
